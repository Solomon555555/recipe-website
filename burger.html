    <!-- Recipe Description (200+ words) -->
    <p>
        The classic burger is one of the most popular and widely enjoyed meals around
        the world. It is loved for its simple preparation, rich flavor, and satisfying
        combination of ingredients. A classic burger usually consists of a grilled
        meat patty placed inside a soft bun and layered with fresh vegetables and
        flavorful sauces. It is commonly served as lunch or dinner and is a favorite
        meal for both adults and children.

        The preparation of a classic burger starts with making the patty, which is
        usually prepared from ground beef seasoned with salt and pepper. The patty
        is shaped into a round form and grilled or fried until it is well cooked and
        slightly browned on the outside. While the patty cooks, the burger buns can
        be lightly toasted to give them a warm and slightly crispy texture. Fresh
        ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese are prepared to
        add flavor and crunch to the burger.

        Once all components are ready, the burger is assembled by placing the patty
        on the bottom bun, followed by cheese, vegetables, and sauce such as ketchup
        or mayonnaise. The top bun is placed over the layers to complete the burger.
        Classic burgers can be customized with additional toppings, but the traditional
        version remains a favorite because of its balanced taste and satisfying bite.
