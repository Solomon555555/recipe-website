        The preparation of Ghana Jollof Rice begins with making a flavorful tomato
        sauce. Fresh tomatoes, onions, peppers, and spices are blended and cooked
        in oil until the sauce becomes thick and rich. Seasonings such as salt,
        ginger, garlic, curry powder, and thyme are added to enhance the flavor.
        Meat, chicken, or fish can be cooked in the sauce to add extra taste before
        the rice is added.

        Washed rice is then poured into the sauce and stirred gently to ensure that
        every grain is coated with the tomato mixture. Water or stock is added, and
        the rice is allowed to cook slowly until it becomes soft and well-seasoned.
        Ghana Jollof Rice is often served with fried chicken, grilled meat, salad,
        or boiled eggs. Its rich taste, smoky aroma, and vibrant color make it a
        favorite dish enjoyed by people of all ages.
