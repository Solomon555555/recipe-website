    <!-- Recipe Description (200+ words) -->
    <p>
        Creamy pasta is a delicious and comforting meal that is loved for its rich texture
        and smooth flavor. This dish is made using pasta, cream, butter, garlic, and cheese,
        which come together to create a soft and satisfying sauce. Creamy pasta is easy to
        prepare and is perfect for lunch or dinner, especially when you want a quick but
        filling meal.

        The preparation starts by boiling pasta in salted water until it becomes tender.
        While the pasta cooks, butter is melted in a pan and garlic is lightly fried to
        release its aroma. Fresh cream is then added and gently heated to form the base
        of the sauce. Cheese such as parmesan or cheddar is stirred in to give the sauce
        a thick and creamy consistency.

        Once the sauce is ready, the cooked pasta is added and mixed thoroughly so that
        every piece is coated with the creamy sauce. Additional ingredients like chicken,
        mushrooms, or vegetables can be added to improve the taste and nutritional value.
        Creamy pasta is best served hot and can be enjoyed on its own or with a side of
        bread or salad. Its smooth texture and rich flavor make it a favorite meal for
        people of all ages.
