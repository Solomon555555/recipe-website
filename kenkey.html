    <p>
        Kenkey and fish is a popular Ghanaian dish, especially in coastal areas.
        Kenkey is made from fermented corn dough that is cooked and wrapped in
        corn husks. It has a slightly sour taste that pairs perfectly with fish
        and pepper sauce.

    <p>
        The fish is usually fried or grilled and served with hot pepper sauce
        made from fresh peppers, onions, and tomatoes. Kenkey is soft, filling,
        and very satisfying when eaten with fish and shito.

    <p>
        Kenkey and fish is commonly sold by street vendors and enjoyed as lunch
        or dinner. It is affordable, tasty, and culturally significant in Ghana.
