        Fufu is made by pounding boiled cassava and plantain until it becomes smooth
        and stretchy. Light soup is a flavorful broth prepared with tomatoes, peppers,
        onions, and spices. This dish is enjoyed across all regions of Ghana.

        by pinching small portions and dipping them into the soup.
