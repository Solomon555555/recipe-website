    <p>
        Banku and Tilapia is a traditional Ghanaian dish that is widely enjoyed across
        the country. It is especially popular in coastal and southern parts of Ghana.
        This meal is loved for its rich taste, cultural significance, and satisfying
        combination of flavors. Banku is a fermented mixture of corn dough and cassava
        dough, while tilapia is a freshwater fish commonly grilled and served with
        spicy pepper sauce.

        The preparation of banku begins by mixing corn dough and cassava dough with
        water and cooking the mixture while stirring continuously. This process
        requires patience and strength, as the mixture becomes thick and smooth.
        Proper stirring ensures that the banku does not form lumps and achieves a
        soft and stretchy texture. Banku is usually served hot and shaped into balls.

        Tilapia is cleaned, seasoned with spices such as ginger, garlic, salt, and
        pepper, and then grilled until it becomes golden and smoky. The fish is
        often served with hot pepper sauce made from blended peppers, onions, and
        tomatoes. Banku and Tilapia is commonly eaten with hands and enjoyed with
        fresh vegetables like onions and peppers. This dish is a symbol of Ghanaian
        cuisine and is enjoyed during family meals, celebrations, and outdoor events.
