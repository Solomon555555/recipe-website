    <!-- Recipe Description (200+ words) -->
    <p>
        Waakye is a traditional Ghanaian dish that is highly popular throughout the
        country. It is a hearty meal made of rice and beans, often cooked together
        with dried millet leaves to give the dish its characteristic brown color.
        Waakye is commonly eaten for breakfast or lunch and is often served with
        a variety of accompaniments such as fried fish, boiled eggs, spaghetti,
        salad, and shito (Ghanaian chili sauce).

        The preparation of Waakye begins by thoroughly washing the rice and beans.
        The beans are soaked for a few hours to soften them, and then both rice and
        beans are boiled together in water with millet leaves, which impart a unique
        color and flavor. The mixture is cooked until both rice and beans are tender
        and well combined. Proper cooking ensures that the rice is fluffy and the
        beans are soft, creating a perfect balance of texture.

        Waakye is often accompanied by protein and side dishes to make it a complete
        meal. Boiled eggs, fried fish, and cooked meats add protein, while spaghetti
        and salad add texture and freshness. Shito or spicy pepper sauce is often
        added to enhance the flavor. Waakye is not only delicious but also filling,
        nutritious, and culturally significant. It is commonly served at roadside
        restaurants, markets, and home gatherings throughout Ghana.
