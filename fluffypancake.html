    <!-- Recipe Description (200+ words) -->
    <p>
        Fluffy pancakes are a popular breakfast meal enjoyed by people of all ages.
        They are known for their soft, light, and airy texture, which makes them very
        enjoyable to eat. Fluffy pancakes are commonly served in the morning with
        toppings such as syrup, butter, fruits, or honey. This recipe focuses on making
        pancakes that rise well and remain soft on the inside.

        The preparation begins by mixing dry ingredients such as flour, baking powder,
        sugar, and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Baking powder is very important because it
        helps the pancakes rise and become fluffy. In a separate bowl, wet ingredients
        like milk, eggs, and melted butter are mixed together. The wet mixture is then
        slowly added to the dry ingredients and gently stirred. Overmixing should be
        avoided because it can make the pancakes flat and hard.

        A pan is lightly greased and heated over medium heat. Small portions of the
        batter are poured onto the pan and cooked until bubbles form on the surface.
        The pancakes are then flipped and cooked until golden brown. Fluffy pancakes
        are best served hot and fresh. They can be enjoyed as a simple breakfast or
        as a special meal during weekends and family gatherings because of their
        delicious taste and soft texture.
