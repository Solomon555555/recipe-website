    <p>
    Cheese pizza is one of the most popular meals in the world because of its simple ingredients
    and delicious taste. The pizza dough is prepared using flour, yeast, water, and salt,
    which gives the base a soft and chewy texture when baked properly.

    The tomato sauce is made from fresh tomatoes and herbs, providing a rich flavor.
    Mozzarella cheese melts evenly and creates the stretchy texture everyone loves.
    Baking at high temperature ensures a crispy crust.
