    <!-- Recipe Description (200+ words) -->
    <p>
        Fresh salad is a healthy and refreshing meal that is enjoyed by people who
        value nutrition and simple cooking. It is made using raw vegetables and
        sometimes fruits, which provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber
        needed for the body. Fresh salad is easy to prepare and does not require
        cooking, making it a perfect choice for a quick meal or side dish.
    </p>

    <p>
        The preparation of a fresh salad begins by selecting clean and fresh
        ingredients such as lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and onions.
        These vegetables are washed thoroughly to remove dirt and then chopped
        into bite-sized pieces. Some salads also include fruits like apples or
        oranges to add natural sweetness and extra flavor. A simple dressing made
        from olive oil, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt can be added to enhance
        the taste without overpowering the natural freshness of the vegetables.

        Fresh salad is very flexible and can be customized according to personal
        preference. Protein sources such as eggs, chicken, or beans can be added
        to make the salad more filling. Fresh salad is best served immediately
        after preparation to maintain its crisp texture and fresh taste. It is
        commonly served as a side dish with main meals or enjoyed on its own as
        a light and nutritious meal.
